Here we go. 

After two failed web projects, a new try. This time with no pretentiousness at all. Only a way to put my thoughs in order about my day-to-day knowledge and my learning path in infosec, specially in the offensive area. 

Although I've worked for the last 20 years on software and web development, IT and System Administration (master of nothing, learner of everything), three years ago, I fell in love with cybersecurity: vulnerability analysis and penetration testing processes, exploiting, red teaming procedures, bug bounty hunting, etc. 

As a newbie in this field, I think I still can contribute and transmit one message: **It's never  too late to improve your skills, and every day is a good day to learn something new**... and put it into practice (ethically, of course)...

So... Let's have fun!
